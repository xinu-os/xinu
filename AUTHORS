   The Xinu operating system was Copyright (c) 1984 by Dr. Douglas
Comer and Prentice Hall, and ran on the LSI-11 platform.  The VAX port
of Xinu was developed in 1987 by Douglas Comer.  The IBM PC port of
Xinu was developed in 1988 by Douglas Comer and Timothy Fossum, and
the 486 version was developed by John Lin in 1995.  The Macintosh
platform port of Xinu was developed in 1989 by Douglas Comer and
Steven Munson.  The Motorola 68000 (Sun 3) port of Xinu was developed
by Shawn Ostermann, circa 1988.  The Sparc port of Xinu was developed
by Jim Griffioen.  The PowerPC port of Xinu was developed in 2005 by
Dennis Brylow.  The MIPS implementation of Embedded Xinu was developed
in 2006 by Dennis Brylow. The ARM implementation of Embedded Xinu was developed
in 2010 by Dennis Brylow and the Embedded Xinu team. The RISC-V implementation 
of Embedded Xinu was developed in 2023 by Alex Gebhard, Jack Forden, and Dennis Brylow. 

   The Embedded Xinu operating system is Copyright (c) 2007, 2008, 2009,
and 2010 by Douglas Comer and Dennis Brylow.

   Embedded Xinu is a fresh reimplementation of the Xinu design in
ANSI-compliant C on an embedded RISC architecture.  The MIPS port of
Embedded Xinu was developed from 2006 to 2010 at Marquette University,
under the direction of Dr. Dennis Brylow.

   Major contributors to the Embedded Xinu Project include Ryan Berg, Tim
Blattner, Aaron Gember, Paul Hinze, Kyle Jackson, Adam Koehler, Zachary Lund,

Dr. Paul Ruth has been instrumental in porting Embedded Xinu to the Qemu
virtual platform.

   Work on Embedded Xinu was made possible in part by support from Marquette
University, the Wehr Foundation, Cisco Systems, Intel Corporation, and the
National Science Foundation (Grant DUE-CCLI-0737476).
