About the Systems Laboratory
----------------------------

`Marquette <http://www.mu.edu/>`__'s `Systems
Laboratory <Systems Laboratory>`__, under the direction of `Dr. Dennis
Brylow <http://www.mscs.mu.edu/~brylow/>`__ in the `Department of
Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer
Science <http://www.mscs.mu.edu/>`__, is housed on the third floor of
Cudahy Hall.

The lab creates new tools and methods for building and studying complex
computer systems. Our emphasis is on embedded, real-time, and network
systems, with strong ties to the electrical and computer engineering
community, and the computer science education community. Current and
recent projects include:

1. Experimental Embedded Networking Platform. Creation of laboratory
infrastructure and software for research and education in the area of
embedded networking appliances, particularly wireless routers and IP
telephony. Collaboration with Cisco Systems Advanced Research Division.

2. Experimental Embedded Operating System Laboratory. Creation of
laboratory infrastructure and software for research and education in
area of embedded operating systems. Collaboration with University of
Buffalo and University of Mississippi, with funding from the `National
Science Foundation <http://www.nsf.gov/>`__.

3. Embedded Software Transactional Memory. Exploration of an innovative
transactional memory model for guaranteeing process synchronization in
embedded operating systems. Collaboration with Intel Research.

4. Many-core Embedded Operating System Laboratory. A port of Embedded
Xinu to the `48-core SCC
processor <http://techresearch.intel.com/ProjectDetails.aspx?Id=1>`__.

The Systems Lab hosts undergraduate `REU <http://acm.mscs.mu.edu/reu>`__
(Research Experience for Undergraduates) students each summer, funded by
a variety of sources including MU's College of Arts and Sciences and the
`National Science Foundation <http://www.nsf.gov/>`__.
