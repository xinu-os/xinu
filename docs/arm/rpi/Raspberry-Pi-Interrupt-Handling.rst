Interrupt handling (Raspberry Pi)
=================================

Interrupt handling on the :doc:`Raspberry-Pi` is concerned with all
software and hardware used to configure and process
:wikipedia:`interrupts`. An example of an interrupt that can be
enabled on the :doc:`Raspberry-Pi` is that from the
:doc:`BCM2835-System-Timer`, which is used in :doc:`XinuPi` to
implement `preemptive multitasking
</arm/ARM-Preemptive-Multitasking>`.  Interrupt handling on the
:doc:`Raspberry-Pi` consists of two complementary parts:

- :doc:`/arm/ARM-Interrupt-Handling`
- :doc:`BCM2835-Interrupt-Controller`
